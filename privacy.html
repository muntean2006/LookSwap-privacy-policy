    <h1>Privacy Policy for LookTune</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 16, 2024</p>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Rares Busuioc</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>LookTune</strong>, an application developed and operated by <strong>Rares Busuioc</strong> ("we," "our," or "us").
    LookTune allows users to try out different <strong>hairstyles, beard styles, and makeup styles</strong> using AI-based image processing.
    It also provides an <strong>attractiveness rating</strong> designed to help users identify which styles best suit their appearance.</p>

    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data responsibly.
    This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how you can manage or delete your data.</p>

    <p>By using LookTune, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1. Account Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To use LookTune, you must create an account using your <strong>email address and password</strong> or a third-party provider like Google.</li>
        <li>User authentication and account management are handled securely by <strong>Google Firebase Authentication</strong>.</li>
        <li>Your <strong>password is fully encrypted and managed by Firebase</strong> — <strong>we never have access to or visibility of your password</strong> at any time.</li>
        <li>We only store your email address for login identification and account-related purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2. Photos and Camera Access</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>LookTune requires permission to access your <strong>camera</strong> (to take a new photo) and <strong>photo gallery</strong> (to select an existing one).</li>
        <li>These permissions are optional and can be controlled in your device settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3. Uploaded Images</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When you upload or capture a photo, it is <strong>temporarily stored</strong> on <strong>Google Cloud Storage</strong> and <strong>Firebase</strong> to process your hairstyle, beard, or makeup transformations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Image Retention Policy:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Images uploaded for AI processing are **automatically deleted immediately after** you receive your results on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.4. Facial Data Processing</h3>
    <p><strong>Important Information About Photo Processing:</strong></p>
    <p>When you use LookTune's transformation features (hairstyles, makeup, beard styles, or beauty score), your uploaded photo is sent to AI image editing services that process the image to apply your requested transformation.</p>

    <h4>How Photo Processing Works:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Your photo is sent to AI image editing models along with your transformation request (e.g., "apply this hairstyle")</li>
        <li>The AI models may internally analyze facial features and positioning to accurately place virtual styles on your face</li>
        <li><strong>LookTune does not explicitly extract, collect, or store facial landmark data, coordinates, or biometric identifiers</strong></li>
        <li>We only receive the final transformed image from the AI service</li>
        <li><strong>No facial recognition or biometric identification is performed</strong> — your face is not used to identify you across photos or build facial profiles</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What the Transformations Do:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hairstyle Transformations:</strong> AI edits the image to add virtual hairstyles</li>
        <li><strong>Makeup Application:</strong> AI edits the image to add virtual makeup</li>
        <li><strong>Beard Styling:</strong> AI edits the image to add virtual beard styles</li>
        <li><strong>Beauty Score:</strong> AI analyzes the photo to generate an attractiveness rating <strong>for entertainment purposes only</strong> (not a medical or health assessment)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Your Photos are NEVER Used For:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Identifying you or creating biometric profiles</li>
        <li>Facial recognition across different photos</li>
        <li>Marketing, advertising, or targeted ads</li>
        <li>Training AI models or algorithm improvements</li>
        <li>Any purpose beyond your explicit transformation request</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Third-Party AI Processing:</h4>
    <p>Your photos are processed by secure third-party AI image editing services. These services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Receive your photo and transformation request (e.g., "add this hairstyle")</li>
        <li>May internally analyze the image as needed to apply transformations accurately</li>
        <li>Return only the final transformed image to LookTune</li>
        <li>Do <strong>not</strong> retain your photos or any extracted data after processing</li>
        <li>Transmit all data using HTTPS encryption</li>
        <li>Are <strong>not</strong> permitted to use your photos for any other purpose</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Photo Retention:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>During Processing:</strong> Your photo is processed temporarily while your transformation is generated (typically 30-60 seconds)</li>
        <li><strong>After Processing:</strong> Your original photo is <strong>automatically deleted immediately</strong> after the transformed image is delivered to your device</li>
        <li><strong>Transformation Results:</strong> Only the final transformed images are stored temporarily (automatically deleted within 2 days)</li>
        <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You can delete transformation results immediately from the app's History screen</li>
        <li><strong>No Permanent Storage:</strong> LookTune does not permanently store your original photos or any facial analysis data</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Your Consent:</h4>
    <p>By using LookTune's transformation features, you consent to the temporary processing of your photos as described above. You may withdraw consent by discontinuing use of the app's transformation features or deleting your account.</p>

    <h4>Compliance with Privacy Regulations:</h4>
    <p>LookTune complies with applicable privacy regulations, including:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act (CUBI)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>2.5. Device and Technical Information</h3>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Attractiveness Score</h2>
    <p>LookTune provides an attractiveness score:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The **Attractiveness Score** is generated by a sophisticated AI model to quantify the attractiveness of your selected style.</li>
        <li><strong>Important:</strong> The Attractiveness Score is generated for <strong>entertainment and style guidance purposes only</strong>. It is not a medical assessment, health measurement, or indication of self-worth. Results are subjective AI-generated estimates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Notifications</h2>
    <p>If enabled, LookTune may send <strong>push notifications</strong> to your device to inform you when your transformation results are ready.
    We do <strong>not</strong> send promotional or marketing messages.</p>
