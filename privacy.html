    <h1>Privacy Policy for LookSwap</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 3, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> LookSwap</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>LookSwap</strong>, an application developed and operated by <strong>LookSwap</strong> (“we,” “our,” or “us”).
    LookSwap allows users to try out different <strong>hairstyles, beard styles, and makeup styles</strong> using AI-based image processing.
    It also provides an <strong>attractiveness rating</strong> and a **User Leaderboard** designed to help users identify which styles best suit their appearance.</p>
    
    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data responsibly.
    This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how you can manage or delete your data.</p>
    
    <p>By using LookSwap, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1. Account Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To use LookSwap, you must create an account using your <strong>email address and password</strong> or a third-party provider like Google.</li>
        <li>User authentication and account management are handled securely by <strong>Google Firebase Authentication</strong>.</li>
        <li>Your <strong>password is fully encrypted and managed by Firebase</strong> — <strong>we never have access to or visibility of your password</strong> at any time.</li>
        <li>We only store your email address for login identification and account-related purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2. Photos and Camera Access</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>LookSwap requires permission to access your <strong>camera</strong> (to take a new photo) and <strong>photo gallery</strong> (to select an existing one).</li>
        <li>These permissions are optional and can be controlled in your device settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3. Uploaded Images</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When you upload or capture a photo, it is <strong>temporarily stored</strong> on <strong>Google Cloud Storage</strong> and <strong>Firebase</strong> to process your hairstyle, beard, or makeup transformations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Image Retention Policy:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Images uploaded for AI processing are **automatically deleted immediately after** you receive your results on your device.</li>
        <li>Images that you **choose to upload to the public Leaderboard** are stored until you manually delete them or delete your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.4. Device and Technical Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We collect non-personal technical data such as device type, operating system, and app version, as well as **Device Identifiers** (such as the Advertising ID) through our analytics services (e.g., Firebase Analytics) to ensure proper app performance and fix bugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Attractiveness Score and Leaderboard</h2>
    <p>LookSwap provides an attractiveness score and allows users to opt-in to a public Leaderboard:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The **Attractiveness Score** is generated by a sophisticated AI model to quantify the attractiveness of your selected style.</li>
        <li>The **Leaderboard** is a public feature where users can voluntarily upload their photos and scores to be viewed and ranked by other users.</li>
        <li>We operate a content moderation system for the Leaderboard to detect and remove inappropriate content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Notifications</h2>
    <p>If enabled, LookSwap may send <strong>push notifications</strong> to your device to inform you when your transformation results are ready.
    We do <strong>not</strong> send promotional or marketing messages.</p>

    <h2>5. Payments and Third-Party Services</h2>

        <h2>7. Account Deletion and Data Management</h2>
        <p>You have the right to delete your account and all associated data at any time. We offer two methods for account deletion:</p>

        <h3>Method 1: In-App Deletion (Recommended)</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Go to the **Settings** menu.</li>
            <li>Select the **Account** section.</li>
            <li>Tap **Delete Account**.</li>
            <li>Confirm your choice.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Method 2: External Request via Email</h3>
        <p>If you cannot access the app, you may request account deletion by emailing us at:</p>
        <p>📧 **<a href="mailto:lookswapapp@gmail.com">lookswapapp@gmail.com</a>**</p>
        <p>Please use the subject line "Account Deletion Request" and include your **registered email address** to help us process your request quickly and securely.</p>

        <h3>Data Deletion Details:</h3>
        <p>Upon account deletion (via either method), we will **permanently delete** the following user data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your LookSwap Account and User ID</li>
            <li>Your registered Email Address</li>
            <li>All photos you uploaded to the public Leaderboard</li>
            <li>All associated Attractiveness Scores and Leaderboard data</li>
            <li>Any user-generated content (e.g., profile bios)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will **only retain** anonymized usage data (e.g., crash logs and aggregated, non-personal statistics) for system stability and reporting purposes, which cannot be linked back to you personally.</p>
        <p>We will confirm the deletion of your account and all personal data within **30 days** of receiving a valid request.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>8. Data Security and Encryption</h2>
    <p>We use <strong>Google Firebase</strong> and <strong>Google Cloud Storage</strong> security measures to protect your data.
    All communications between your device and our servers are encrypted using **HTTPS** (encryption in transit).
    Access to your stored data is strictly limited to secure automated systems.</p>

    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy and Target Audience (Policy Correction)</h2>
    <p>**LookSwap is designed for and targets users aged 18 and over.**</p>
    <p>Due to the nature of the app's features (such as the Attractiveness Score and public Leaderboard for photo sharing), this app is **not intended for children**.
    If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a user under the age of 18 without parental consent, we will take steps to delete their account and associated data promptly.</p>

    <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You may:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access, correct, or **delete your data** at any time using the methods described in **Section 7**.</li>
        <li>Withdraw permission for camera or gallery access via your device settings.</li>
        <li>Contact us for data inquiries at <a href="mailto:lookswapapp@gmail.com">lookswapapp@gmail.com</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically.
    When updates occur, the “Last Updated” date at the top will be revised and the updated version will be made available in the app and on our website (if applicable).</p>
