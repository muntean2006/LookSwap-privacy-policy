    <hr>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>LookTune</strong>. These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the LookTune mobile application (the "App"), developed and operated by <strong>Rares Busuioc</strong> ("we," "us," or "our").</p>
    
    <p>By downloading, accessing, or using LookTune, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>By using the App, you represent and warrant that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are at least <strong>18 years of age</strong>; OR</li>
        <li>You are the <strong>parent or legal guardian</strong> of a minor dependent who uses the App, and you explicitly consent to such minor dependent’s use of the App and agree to be bound by these Terms on their behalf.</li>

    <p>If you are a parent or guardian enabling a minor to use the App, you acknowledge that you are fully responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The minor’s online conduct.</li>
        <li>Controlling the minor’s access to and use of the App.</li>
        <li>The consequences of any misuse by the minor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. AI Features and Functionality</h2>
    <div class="disclaimer-box">
        <strong>NOTICE REGARDING AI RESULTS:</strong><br>
        LookTune uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate hairstyle, beard, and makeup visualizations and to provide aesthetic analysis via an "Attractiveness Score."
    </div>
    
    <h3>3.1. Style Visualization</h3>
    <p>The images generated by the App are AI-based simulations intended to assist users in making decisions about their personal style and grooming. While the App aims for high-quality realism, we cannot guarantee that the styles (hair, beard, or makeup) generated can be perfectly replicated in reality by a stylist or barber.</p>

    <h3>3.2. Attractiveness Score and Analysis</h3>
    <p>The "Attractiveness Score" is a quantitative metric generated by AI analysis for <strong>entertainment and style guidance purposes only</strong>.</p>

    <div class="disclaimer-box">
        <strong>Important:</strong> This score is:
        <ul style="margin: 10px 0;">
            <li><strong>NOT a medical assessment or health measurement</strong></li>
            <li><strong>NOT an indication of self-worth or personal value</strong></li>
            <li>A subjective AI-generated estimate for fun and style comparison</li>
            <li>Intended to help users explore which styles may suit them best</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>The score should be used as a reference point for personal style exploration, not as a definitive measure of attractiveness.</p>
